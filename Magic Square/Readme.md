A square matrix is called magic square  if the sums of the numbers in each row, each column, and both main diagonals are the same and all the elements of Magic Square
are positive & unique between range 1-9.
The order of the magic square is the number of integers along one side (n), and the constant sum is called the magic constant. 
If the array includes just the positive integers {\displaystyle 1,2,...,n^{2}}{\displaystyle 1,2,...,n^{2}}, the magic square is said to be normal. 
Some authors take magic square to mean normal magic square.

The matrix looks like this:

8 3 4   ----> 15
1 5 9   ----> 15
6 7 2   ----> 15
